## Quick start

> If you're using Laravel `4.2.*` or `5.0.*` on PHP `5.4` & above, Please use `0.5` branch. Otherwise, Just follow the below instructions.
>
> **Note:** `0.5` branch is outdated and no longer supported. Consider upgrading if you're one of those users.

### Install

#### Step 1: Install Through Composer

You can either add the package directly by firing this command

``` bash
$ composer require irazasyed/laravel-gamp
```

Or add in the `require` key of `composer.json` file manually

```json
"irazasyed/laravel-gamp": "^1.0"
```

And Run the Composer update command

``` bash
$ composer update
```

#### Step 2: Add the Service Provider

##### Laravel

Open `config/app.php` and, to your "providers" array at the bottom, add:

``` php
Irazasyed\LaravelGAMP\LaravelGAMPServiceProvider::class
```

##### Lumen

Open `bootstrap/app.php` and add register the service provider by adding:

``` php
$app->register(Irazasyed\LaravelGAMP\LaravelGAMPServiceProvider::class);
```

#### Step 3: Add Facade (Optional) (Laravel Only)

Optionally add an alias to make it easier to use the library. Open `config/app.php` and, to your "aliases" array at the bottom, add:

``` php
'GAMP'  => Irazasyed\LaravelGAMP\Facades\GAMP::class
```

#### Step 4: Publish Config (Laravel Only)

Open your terminal window and fire the following command to publish config file to your config directory:

``` bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Irazasyed\LaravelGAMP\LaravelGAMPServiceProvider"
```

OR

``` bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish
```

The former command publishes config file for just this package and the latter publishes vendor files for other packages too. Depending on what you want to do, you can use any (Doesn't really matter).


## Usage

Open config file `config/gamp.php` and set the `tracking_id` with your Google Analytics tracking / web property ID.
Refer the config file for other default configuration settings.

This Package adds Laravel Support to [GA Measurement Protocol][link-lib] PHP Library by THE ICONIC.
It's simply a wrapper around the library with default config for easier usage with Laravel.
So all the methods listed [here][link-docs] are available and will work seamlessly.

### Example Usage

Send a Page view hit:

``` php
use Irazasyed\LaravelGAMP\Facades\GAMP;

$gamp = GAMP::setClientId( '123456' );
$gamp->setDocumentPath( '/page' );
$gamp->sendPageview();
```

Send an Event:

``` php
use Irazasyed\LaravelGAMP\Facades\GAMP;

$gamp = GAMP::setClientId( '123456' );
$gamp->setEventCategory('Blog Post')
->setEventAction('Create')
->setEventLabel('Using GAMP In Laravel')
->sendEvent();
```

### Config Overview

Open the config file for detailed comments for each option.

Set your Google Analytics Tracking / Web Property ID in `tracking_id` key **[REQUIRED]**

``` php
'tracking_id' => 'UA-XXXX-Y',
```

All other configuration options are optional, use as per your requirements.

To send data over SSL, set `is_ssl` to true.

``` php
'is_ssl' => true,
```

To disable library in Staging/Dev env (Prevents the library from sending any hits to GA), set `is_disabled` to true.

``` php
'is_disabled' => true,
```

To Anonymize IP, set `anonymize_ip` to true.

``` php
'anonymize_ip' => true,
```

To Make Async Requests, set `async_requests` to true.

``` php
'async_requests'  => true,
```

...

Refer the library's [documentation][link-docs] for other remaining methods and examples, they all work.

> **Note:** You don't have to use the protocol version, tracking id, anonymize ip and async request (non-blocking) methods from the original library as they're automatically set in Service Provider when the package is initialized based on the config file. As long as you update the config file with correct settings, it should work just fine.
